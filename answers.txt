2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Answer:
Fast-forward corresponds to merging branches which are in the same commit path, the two branches are not divergent to each other. It can be said that it is similar to moving pointer of older commit branch to latest commit branch as long as they are not divergent.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Answer:
Branching allows developers to isolate their work form others, any changes to master branch or other branches will not affect their branch. If there is a new task for bug-fix or adding new features, developers can branch out from original code so it does not affect the working code and merge back once developing new feature/bug fix is completed.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Answer:
There is usually one repository for one project.
